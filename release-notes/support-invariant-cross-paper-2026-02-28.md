# Support-Invariant Cross-Paper Tightening - 2026-02-28

This release note captures a focused framing pass to make "coherence requires support" explicit across papers and companion docs, without re-architecting sections or changing gate behavior.

## Scope

- Added short support-invariant language to papers where the claim was still implicit.
- Kept edits additive and compact (paragraph-level only).
- Updated local companion notes for replay suite and retrieval gates to map support deficit directly to existing abstain/gather behavior.

## Updated papers

- `papers/baseline-regulation-and-global-constraint-signals-in-embodied-control-systems/main.tex`
- `papers/why-intelligent-systems-waste-energy/main.tex`
- `papers/toward-a-coherent-human-baseline/main.tex`
- `papers/the-time-to-analysis-layer-pressure-points-in-ai-assisted-research-systems/main.tex`

Mirrors were updated in lockstep for each of the above.

## Companion docs updated

- `regulated-agent-replay-suite/regulated-agent-replay-suite-v0.md`
- `regulated-retrieval-gates/regulated-retrieval-gates-v0.md`
- `REPLAY_SUITE.md`

## Redundancy check outcome

The following papers already contained strong support-invariant language and were intentionally left unchanged to avoid duplication:

- `papers/two-regime-control-latent-coordination-vs-compensation-in-intelligent-systems/main.tex`
- `papers/concept-containers-as-representation-level-regulation-in-artificial-agents/main.tex`
- `papers/regulatory-ground-for-agentic-ai-why-trustworthy-discovery-requires-band-limited-optimization/main.tex`
