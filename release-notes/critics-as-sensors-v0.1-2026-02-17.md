# Critics-as-Sensors (`v0.1`) - 2026-02-17

## Delta Summary

- Added implementation pointer paragraph for replayable CI-gate operationalization.
- Added retrieval-gate analogue paragraph clarifying upstream selection-signal governance.

## Key Conceptual Upgrades

- Tightened bridge between theory (critics as telemetry) and executable harness behavior.
- Clarified bounded-variation target: stable commit/withhold decisions, not identical prose artifacts.

## New Terms / Definitions

- Retrieval-gate analogue.

## Implications

- Makes the note directly actionable for pipeline design (retrieval + selection + commit).
- Improves interoperability with Verifier Gap and Regulatory Ground framing.

## Open Questions

- How should critic drift and retrieval-signal drift be jointly monitored?
- Which perturbations are minimally sufficient for stability claims?
