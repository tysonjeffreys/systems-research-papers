# Concept Containers (v1.1)

Minimal update from v1.0 to align with the runtime regulation framing developed in *Regulatory Ground for Agentic AI*:

- Adds a short bridge: containers as representation-level boundary conditions that reduce intervention load for runtime regulators.
- Adds an interface subsection (posture-modulated reuse; regulated container writes).
- Adds longitudinal revision persistence metrics (revision half-life, reversal count, constraint imprint).
- Adds a short integration subsection for regulated agent stacks.
