# Why Intelligent Systems Waste Energy (v1.0)

This paper argues that energy waste in intelligent systems is often architectural, not just implementation-level, and introduces baseline regulation as the missing control layer.

Core contributions:
- Proposes baseline regulation as a first-class architectural primitive.
- Formalizes a convex energy model with duty-cycle framing.
- Connects regulated agent dynamics to infrastructure-level energy savings.
- Defines falsifiable experiments for inference systems, agent loops, and robotics.
