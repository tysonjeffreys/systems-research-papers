# Regulated Agent Replay Suite: A Minimal CI Gate for Verifier-Free Discovery (v0.1)

This paper specifies a minimal CI-style governance gate for verifier-free discovery systems, where commits are controlled by telemetry and rollback discipline rather than perfect verifiers.

Core focus:
- Defines a practical replay/gating loop for non-verifiable discovery workflows.
- Establishes bounded commit, rollback, and audit expectations.
- Connects policy posture and telemetry to release decisions.
- Keeps implementation coupling explicit through companion harness repositories.
