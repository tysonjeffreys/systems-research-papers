# Toward a Coherent Human Baseline (v1.0)

This paper characterizes a low-noise physiological baseline and argues that autonomic/respiratory coherence can be established through breath regulation, with meditation acting as an enhancement layer rather than the initial mechanism.

Core focus:
- Defines a coherent baseline state (low internal noise, preserved alertness).
- Separates physiological baseline formation from meditative refinement.
- Connects baseline coherence to reduced reactivity and improved stability.
- Outlines limitations and testable next steps.
