# Critics-as-Sensors Abstention-Gated Selection for Verifier-Free Discovery (v0.1)

This paper treats learned critics/judges as uncertainty sensors rather than authorities, using abstention/tie mass to govern bounded selection in verifier-free settings.

Core focus:
- Formalizes judge-as-sensor telemetry for non-verifiable domains.
- Uses abstain/tie mass and disagreement as first-class uncertainty signals.
- Constrains candidate generation and selection under uncertainty.
- Links commit permissions to uncertainty-aware gating.
