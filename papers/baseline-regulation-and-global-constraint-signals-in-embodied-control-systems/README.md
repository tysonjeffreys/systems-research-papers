# Baseline Regulation and Global Constraint Signals in Embodied Control Systems (v1.0)

This paper introduces baseline regulation as the stabilizing layer for embodied systems and motivates global constraint signals as shared boundary conditions for distributed control.

Core focus:
- Baseline regulation in biological systems as an architectural reference.
- Global constraint signals for low-cost synchronization across subsystems.
- Predictive coupling as a regulator of energetic/control cost.
- Design implications for robust embodied AI and robotics.
