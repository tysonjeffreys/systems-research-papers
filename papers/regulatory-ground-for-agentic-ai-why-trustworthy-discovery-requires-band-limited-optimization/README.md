# Regulatory Ground for Agentic AI (v1.4.1)

Minimal update from v1.2:
- Adds Section 11.6 (constraint placement A/B: in-loop shaping vs exogenous regulation)
- Updates the title-page version line to 1.4.1 (Feb 11, 2026)

- Adds Section 7.x: validating/change-controlling the telemetry→posture mapping for g(t)
- Adds Section 7.x: judge-as-sensor (treat learned critics/judges as telemetry; tie/abstain mass drives posture)
- Fixes the g(t) and risk-scoring equations (previously corrupted by PDF text artifacts)
