# The Time-to-Analysis Layer Pressure Points in AI-Assisted Research Systems (v1.2)

This paper analyzes why analysis-ready insight, not draft volume, is the bottleneck in AI-assisted research workflows and proposes controls that prioritize reusable analytical progress.

Core focus:
- Identifies pressure points between idea generation and analysis conversion.
- Frames progress in terms of reusable analysis artifacts rather than raw output.
- Connects runtime regulation and commit discipline to research throughput.
- Proposes measurable operational metrics for time-to-analysis performance.
