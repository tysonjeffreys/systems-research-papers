# Two-Regime Control: Latent Coordination vs Compensation in Intelligent Systems (v1.2)

This paper formalizes a two-regime view of intelligent control and introduces measurable compensation metrics for regulating high-cost instability.

Core focus:
- Separates latent coordination from compensation-dominant operation.
- Defines compensation index and duty-cycle style telemetry.
- Adds baseline regulator objectives that penalize sustained compensation.
- Connects runtime regulation to energy and robustness outcomes.
