# Concept Containers as Representation-Level Regulation in Artificial Agents (v1.3)

This paper defines concept containers as reusable, intervention-relevant representations and frames them as a regulation layer that reduces internal contention and compute waste.

Core focus:
- Formalizes container sufficiency for intervention-aware prediction.
- Connects container quality to duty-cycle and energy/compute stability.
- Specifies posture-aware reuse and regulated commit/update behavior.
- Proposes practical quality metrics and evaluation criteria.
