# Frictionless Agency (v0.2)

**Dysregulation, Override, and Regulation as Proto-Ethics in Tool-Using and Embodied Systems**  
Version 0.2 — February 27, 2026

## Abstract (short)
Many costly failures in humans and agents begin with **dysregulation**: sustained operation outside a stable, recoverable band.
This note treats “ethics” as partially downstream of posture, proposing **regulation as proto-ethics**: abstention under uncertainty,
bounded override, recovery enforcement, and commit governance.

## Core contributions
- Defines friction as sustained deviation above baseline + thrash penalty.
- Defines dysregulation as a dynamical regime (prolonged compensation, weak recovery).
- Introduces proto-ethics as restraint-by-default (posture, not values).
- Presents a 4-layer regulated stack: risk posture → phase → verifier-gap selection → commit governance.
- Proposes metrics + replay/ablation evaluation to make the claims falsifiable.
