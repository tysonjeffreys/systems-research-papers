# Frictionless Agency (v0.2)

This paper frames dysregulation and override as governable system behaviors, positioning regulation as a proto-ethical substrate for safer autonomous action.

Core focus:
- Defines friction as sustained baseline deviation plus thrash.
- Treats override as a priced capability with mandatory recovery.
- Organizes control into posture, phase, bounded selection, and commit governance.
- Proposes falsifiable metrics and replay-style evaluation for regulated agency.
