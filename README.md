## Series Overview

This library focuses on regulated intelligence systems: how agents should reason, select, and commit under uncertainty without drifting into unsafe or high-cost behavior.

- Baseline regulation and posture control: global constraint signals, operating bands, budgets, rollback, and governance.
- Selection under missing verifiers: bounded candidate generation, judge-as-sensor telemetry, abstention/tie signals, and commit gating.
- Representation and analysis discipline: concept containers, analysis artifacts, and phase-structured runtime transitions.
- Embodied and systems grounding: compensation vs coordination regimes, energy pressure, and biologically inspired baseline control.
- Operationalization: replay harnesses and retrieval gates that turn policy into executable governance checks.

## Paper Summaries

- **Baseline Regulation and Global Constraint Signals in Embodied Control Systems**: introduces baseline-aware control and global constraint signaling to keep distributed subsystems aligned under stress.
- **Concept Containers as Representation-Level Regulation in Artificial Agents**: defines containerized representation updates as regulated commits with provenance, falsifiers, and persistence checks.
- **Critics-as-Sensors Abstention-Gated Selection for Verifier-Free Discovery**: formalizes critics as telemetry (not authorities) and uses abstention-gated bounded selection for verifier-free tasks.
- **Phase Discipline for Regulated Agents**: adds runtime phase control (restore, transition, act) to enforce state-action alignment and safer commit timing.
- **Regulated Agent Replay Suite: A Minimal CI Gate for Verifier-Free Discovery**: specifies a practical replay and gating harness that enforces commit discipline and stability checks.
- **Regulatory Ground for Agentic AI**: provides the core architecture and governance model for band-limited optimization, posture control, and safe discovery loops.
- **The Time-to-Analysis Layer Pressure Points in AI-Assisted Research Systems**: argues for analysis artifacts over summary output and defines metrics for intervention-ready reasoning speed.
- **The Verifier Gap: Regulation for Non-Verifiable Reasoning**: names the regime where selection exists without verification and introduces the Verifier Gap Layer.
- **Toward a Coherent Human Baseline**: proposes a human baseline framing for coherent regulation targets and longitudinal adaptation.
- **Toward a Lower Human Metabolic Baseline**: explores reduced energetic baseline as a systems objective and its implications for stable intelligence.
- **Two-Regime Control: Latent Coordination vs Compensation in Intelligent Systems**: models intelligent behavior as a shift between efficient latent coordination and costly compensation.
- **Why Intelligent Systems Waste Energy**: explains energy waste as a control and representation pathology rather than a purely hardware or scale issue.
