## 2026-02-17 (Backfill Release)

This is a semantic backfill release for pre-git paper edits. History is summarized per paper in `release-notes/`.

### Papers Updated

- Regulatory Ground (`v1.4.1`): operational reproducibility profile + replay-suite reference implementation.
- Verifier Gap (`v0.1`): retrieval-generation vs selection distinction, retrieval-gate artifact mapping, and reproducibility-without-verifiers language.
- Concept Containers (`v1.1`): abstention-gated container write discipline (`RG-07`) added near regulated writes.
- Critics-as-Sensors (`v0.1`): replay-gate implementation pointer and retrieval-gate analogue.
- Two-Regime Control (`v1.1` updated): phase-discipline commit-window language tied to telemetry-driven posture gating.
